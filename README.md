# ESimConnect

A simple library to connect and work with SimConnect, a library allowing to communicate with Flight Simulators (e.g., FS2020).

The aim of this library is to provide a simple interface to work with FS2020 over .NET/C# without no deep knowledge of SimConnect. On the other side, only the basic operations are supported. This library is not convering all the possibilities of original SimConnect library.

## Requirements

The library needs Windows .NET Core 6.0 runtime to be installed (this is included in Windows 10+ instalation by default).

## Instalation

Just unpack the required release to a target project run folder and link ESimConnect.dll + other provided libraries to your project.
Note: To work, a file `SimConnect.dll` must be also included in your project output directory. This file will not be referenced in your .NET project, but must be present to be loaded for library usage.
